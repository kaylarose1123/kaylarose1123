- 👋 Hi, I’m Kayla!
- 👀 I’m interested in animals, volleyball, fantasy books/shows and learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding from scratch! Took a basic course on SheCodes and am now working through a Udemy course.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where someone is willing to help me continue to learn!
